PACKAGE (0.2) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * Initial release. 0.2
    Program works on terminal, but is easy to use.
    Download from Submanga.
  * 0.3. Enabled Mangafox
    Mangafox already works. Copy the URL of a chapter and paste it. It can be
    used for single downloads and bulk-like downloads with a "for i in `seq`"
    loop with $i where should be written the chapter number.
  * 0.4 Enabled Mangareader and minor changes.
    You can now download single chapters from Mangareader. Just copy the url
    of a chapter and run baamanga to download it.
    Restructuration to improve makefile, and make the program be able to be
    properly compiled.
    Some simplifications.
