# baamanga
Manga downloader for linux, (working on windows aswell). Runs on command prompt.

Baamanga is yet under development so this is just a skell that is going to grow bigger every day, little by little. By now, it is intended to be a simple Manga downloader: don't download that Manga you like page by page, just copy the url and paste it on your terminal. It will do the rest. 

## Installation
To install baamanga just run:
* cmake .
* make
* make install

## Expected functions
Baamanga will get your url, parse it and download the contents you want. You just have to copy, paste and relax while your chapters go to your folder ready for you, on image format or with all of its pages put together on a single pdf.

## To do
This is the beginning, once baamanga is fully functional, GUI's development will start giving to you a beauty interface to make what you can do on the terminal with the simplicity of your mouse.
