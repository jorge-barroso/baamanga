# baamanga
Manga downloader for linux, (working on windows aswell). Runs on terminal, GUI coming soon.

Baamanga is yet under development so this is just a skell that is going to grow bigger every day, little by little. By now, it is intended to be a simple Manga downloader: don't download that Manga you like page by page, just copy the url and paste it on your terminal. It will do the rest. 

## Installation
To install baamanga just run:
* autoreconf --install
* ./configure
* make
* make install

## Expected functions
Once baamanga works properly, it will get your url, parse it and download the content you want. You just have to copy, past and relax while it goes to your folder ready for you, on image format or with all of those images put together on a single pdf.

## To do
Obviously this is the beginning, once baamanga is fully functional, GUI's development will start giving to you a beauty interface to make what you can do on the terminal with the simplicity of your mouse.

#Dependencies
Eventually, baamanga's dependencies are thought to be:
* curlcpp
* Gtk //NOT YET
